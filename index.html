            The power in a book consists in its ability to make you think beyond
            the superficial. It transforms you from ‘good to better‟ and ‘great
            to greater.’

            A pastel color is defined as any hue with a high value (lightness)

            The power in a book consists in its ability to make you think beyond
            the superficial. It transforms you from ‘good to better‟ and ‘great
            to greater.’ Think of the books you have read in the course of your
            life, which have refused to let you go. Think of books that you read
            and you cried and shed tears even today anytime you remember the
            plots and the moving contents. Think of how certain books have
            altered your speech and writing patterns forever. Think of certain
            words that stuck to your pen and lips and which pop up each time you
            write or speak. Those words are most likely from old books you read
            long ago, or new ones that have left their imprints in your
            sub-conscious. That is the power of a book. It is life-changing.

            They define landscapes, people risk their lives to climb them, and
            they can even make their own weather. The mighty chunks rise all
            over the world, including the oceans. They usually have steep,
            sloping sides and sharp or rounded ridges, and a high point, called
            a peak or summit. Most geologists classify a mountain as a landform
            that rises at least 1,000 feet (300 meters) or more above its
            surrounding area. A mountain range is a series or chain of mountains
            that are close together.

            That is in fact a pretty wide breadth, meaning more colors are
            technically pastels than you might have thought. In practice,
            however, when people say “pastel” they usually refer to a more
            limited palette including mint green, mauve, coral and robin’s egg
            blue.
